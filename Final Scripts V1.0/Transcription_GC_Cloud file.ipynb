      "Transcript:  Design feasibility.\n",
      "Transcript:  Durability low-maintenance and G's activity.\n",
      "Transcript:  I hope this is FX planet.\n",
      "Transcript:  Thank you.\n",
      "Transcript:  The next light is also a technical information that finished eyes doing powder. Coating over a new Dynasty to what is the basic difference of what? What is the USB of powder coating over? Analyzing to the color option in the powder, coating? We have wide variety of color choices because artists use\n",
      "Transcript:  Magnetic sheets, but entire night, I would izing have limited number of career options.\n",

      "Transcript:  Notice that for the finished product range.\n",
      "Transcript:  So the finished our aluminum product range has been divided into three categories. First is ultra-luxury system in which we have Slimline sliding rules, lift and slide slider to and sad and full deuces.\n",
      "Transcript:  Then we have super luxury Series in which we have slider dose, slider windows case, Mentos casement, windows and third is luxury Series in which again, we have slider dose slider, windows casement, doors casement windows. And when we are talking about luxury series, that means that the product being offered in Project segment.\n",
      "Transcript: \n",
      "Transcript:  So we'll start by ultra-luxe editions first.\n",

      "Transcript:  so, the features of this product are\n",
      "Transcript:  First thermal brick profile and double thermal break out of frames. Often High Energy Efficiency, aluminum frame conceived within the walls, maximize maximize, the natural light in the room. Minimal sidelines of 25m at the interlock and, and the submerged threshold facility.\n",
      "Transcript:  It's Vision, concealed Channel allows us for hassle-free water. Drainage up to 500 kg weight capacity, offers the possibility of installing Lords, and special classes option. Also available in corner, slider, and the glass thickness is 45mm to forty. Six point two eight. Mmm.\n",
      "Transcript:  So before going ahead we need to understand he what is the difference between a non-thermal natural Series in aluminum system? As we all know, aluminum is a good conductor of heat, but to return to reduce the heat transfer of our or we can say for a better thermal insulation. There is a product called as polyamide.\n",
      "Transcript:  Using our system so that it can reduce the heat loss.\n",
      "Transcript:  So in thermal break system, we are using volume polyamide material in the outer frame as well as in sections. So that the intensity of heat transfer of heat loss can be released.\n",
      "Transcript:  So the USB of Slimline slider do. First of all, better thermal insulation as we are using polyamide material. Second. USB of this product is the outer frame can be concealed in wall, allowing more sunlight more glass area. So all you can see is only the internet.\n",
      "Transcript:  This.\n",
      "Transcript:  Interlock sidelines of 25m. This is all visible over there.\n",

      "Transcript:  Plus mesh.\n",
      "Transcript:  So that is that is the USB of this pregnant one. When we say in a slider family. We want sound insulation. So left hand side is our first priority and if we can have a integrated mesh, so that this icing on the top, so bought, that is what's in, it says offering, we are offering integrated mesh system in distance, right tools, along, with child safety mechanism. Because the\n",
      "Transcript:  Know, if the panels are huge in this product. So for a, for the safety of child, we have introduced this child safety mechanism in our handles.\n",
      "Transcript: \n",
